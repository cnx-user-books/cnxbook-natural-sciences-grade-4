When they travel too fast, they will veer off into outer space. If they are too slow, they will fall to the earth. People on earth use computers to control the speed of the satellites.</para>

          <item>Draw 32 blocks of the same size on a clean sheet of paper. Your teacher will show you pictures of a spacecraft being launched as an example. You can draw this or choose your own theme for your picture book.</item>
          <item>Now draw a picture in each block showing the spacecraft taking off. Each block must show the craft a little further away from the launching pad and moving up into space. When the pages are bound together, you can let them flip and it will seem as if the spacecraft is lifting off.</item>
          <item>When all your pictures are complete, cut them out neatly. Make two holes on the one side and place them in the correct order â€“ 1 to 32 with number 1 at the bottom. Thread string through the holes to bind them. You could strengthen it with Sellotape.</item>
          <item>Now hold your book by the side that is bound and flick through the pages from the back to the front with your other hand. Your picture should move. This should be great fun!</item>
