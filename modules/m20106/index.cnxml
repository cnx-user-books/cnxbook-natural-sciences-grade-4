        <para id="id15298377">People discovered how to make fire very long ago. At first they used sticks found in the veld and rubbed these together long and hard, to make them warm. (You can do this to feel how warm they become.) When really hot, a spark would be generated and this could ignite dry leaves and grass. You can also feel the heat that is generated when you rub your hands together. Such rubbing is known as creating friction. </para>

        <para id="id15278506">When you make your fire, warm the soup and drink it, a scientific process takes place. When you lit the fire to burn the wood, chemical energy was changed into heat energy. The heat energy boiled the soup. When you ate the soup, your body changed the chemical energy in the soup to potential energy. Then your body changed it into kinetic energy (energy for movement) that is useful on a camping expedition. Your body changes energy. Some of the chemical energy that you obtain through food is changed into potential energy and then into kinetic energy. Some of the chemical energy is changed into heat energy to keep your body warm.</para>
